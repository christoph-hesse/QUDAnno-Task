"><node surface="A2: Prime Minister: Well, I think that it's going about as well as could be, especially, if not slightly better. " category="" /></node><node surface="" category="Q3: LK: Really? "><node surface="A3.1: PM: Yeah." category="" /><node surface="" category="Q3.1.1: {Why does Johnson think that things are going as well as could be?}"><node surface="A3.1.1: Because look, this was always going to be a very difficult time.

" category="" /></node><node surface="" category="Q12.2: {What is the most complex task of the extrication?}"><node surface="A12.2: And the most complex thing is clearly trying to unravel our relationship with the EU customs union and the EU single market, and the empire of the EU law as it were.

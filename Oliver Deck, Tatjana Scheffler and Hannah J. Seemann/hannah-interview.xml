<node surface="" category="Q0: {What is the way things are?} "><node surface="" category="Q1: {What has the Prime Minister been doing in the last few weeks?}"><node surface="A1a: Laura Kuenssberg: Prime Minister, in the last few weeks, you've lost major votes in the Commons, " category="" /><node surface="A1b: you've chucked some MPs out of your own party, " category="" /><node surface="A1c: the highest court in the land has found you broke the law and gave the wrong advice to the Queen. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q2: How do you think this is going? "><node surface="A2: Prime Minister: Well, I think that it's going about as well as could be, especially, if not slightly better. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q3: LK: Really? "><node surface="" category="A3: PM: Yeah. "><node surface="" category="Q4: {why is that?}"><node surface="A4: Because look, this was always going to be a very difficult time. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q5: {Why was it going to be a very difficult time?}"><node surface="A5a: What we've got, basically, is a situation in which the people voted for leaving the EU in the greatest expression of popular will in favour of any party or proposition in history. " category="" /><node surface="A5b:And, yes, there are many people in all sorts of positions, who don't think that was the right way to go. " category="" /><node surface="A5c:And I am tasked with getting it over the line, getting Brexit done by October 31. " category="" /><node surface="" category="A5d:And I think we always knew that as we came up to that deadline, things would get choppy, but..."><node surface="" category="Q6: LK: You are blaming all of your woes on people who are trying to stop Brexit?"><node surface="" category="Q7: {How is the situation compared to predictions?}"><node surface="A7a: PM: No, I think it's just the just the predicament, is just the it's just the situation, that we're in as a country. " category="" /><node surface="A7b: And I think that things are actually much much better than they, than the political situation, might lead you to believe. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q8: {In what ways is the situation better?}"><node surface="A8a: Unemployment is at record lows. " category="" /><node surface="A8b: Foreign direct investment is at record highs. " category="" /><node surface="A8c: We're seeing this country at the cutting edge of innovation in everything from battery technology to bio science, " category="" /><node surface="A8d: we are doing fantastically well in so many ways. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q9: {How good the situation still be improved?}"><node surface="A9a: And if only we could all come together, get Brexit over the line, I think that fevers would cool, tempers would come down. " category="" /><node surface="A9b:And it would be a great thing." category="" /><node surface="" category="Q10: {What is the PM saying now?}"><node surface="A10: LK: But you're suggesting that people ought to come together, " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q11: {What has the PM been saying before?}"><node surface="A11a: when transparently, you have been trying to create this idea of them and us, " category="" /><node surface="A11b: you who want to get Brexit done, which you said every possible opportunity. " category="" /><node surface="A11c: And the people on the other side, which you've just suggested, are only trying to hold you up and stop Brexit. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q12: And that's transparent, you're trying to create a situation of them and us are you not? "><node surface="A12a: PM: I think that the truth is, there's no way of getting Brexit done without, as it were, displeasing people who don't want Brexit to get done - " category="" /><node surface="A12bxs: no way of delivering Brexit, sort of 52% Brexit and 48% Remain, that's just logically impossible. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q13: {How can this be evaluated?}"><node surface="A13: And so that I think is, is the problem. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q14: {What can be done after the problem is solved?}"><node surface="A14: But I think once we get it done, and once we can begin building a new partnership with our new friends, once we can start thinking about how we can do things differently, how we can interact with the rest of the world, how we can recover on our impetus, our mojos, as a global outward looking... " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q15: {How does the PM evaluate this idea of the future?}"><node surface="" category="A15: I think things will will go really well for us. "><node surface="" category="Q16: {How are things going now?} "><node surface="A16: And they already are going very well for us." category="" /><node surface="" category="Q17: LK: But as things stand, are you prime minister sitting there and saying that the last couple of months is anything like a normal situation?"><node surface="A17: PM: No, " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q18: {why?}"><node surface="A18a: because obviously what the UK is going through is a big constitutional change. " category="" /><node surface="A18b: The extrication, after 45 years of our legal system, from the orbit of European law, which is you know, has become very, very pervasive." category="" /><node surface="A18c:It's a very complicated thing to do. " category="" /><node surface="A18d: And the most complex thing is clearly trying to unravel our relationship with the EU customs union and the EU single market, and the empire of the EU law as it were. " category="" /><node surface="" category="Q19: LK: Let's talk about that. So let's be completely clear, under the proposals that you were about to take to Brussels, there would be extra checks on the island of Ireland, how and where?"><node surface="" category="Q20: {Are the proposals already made?}"><node surface="A20a: PM: Well, I mean, if I made the the proposals are not yet made, " category="" /><node surface="A20b: I probably ought to make them to the EU..." category="" /><node surface="" category="Q21: {What about those proposals?}"><node surface="" category="A21: LK: But you know there are suggestions of what is out there, which you deny. "><node surface="" category="Q22: So how would you describe what you will put forward? "><node surface="" category="Q23: {Why are there restrictions to what can be done?}"><node surface="A23a: PM: What I can say is that, and I think this is crucial for everybody to understand, because it's just the limit of what a sovereign country can can do. " category="" /><node surface="A23b: If the EU is going to insist on customs checks as we come out as it as it is, then we will have to accept that reality. " category="" /><node surface="A23c: And there will have to be a system, for customs checks away from the border. " category="" /></node><node surface="" category="A22: Now, we think those checks can be absolutely minimal and non-intrusive and won't involve new infrastructure. "><node surface="" category="Q24: {Will this be done easily?}"><node surface="A24a: But that is absolutely, Laura, that is where the argument is going to be. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A24b: And that's where the negotiation will be will be tough" category="" /></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node></node>
